vary enemy movement or awareness of state/other/goals - try to avoid mob mentality of stacking
^stateful enemy and transitions

perhaps also simple navigation system based on waypoints

could also adjust quantity/quality of enemies, maybe less enemies more difficulty

perhaps less health for each enemy, or increase knockback by a lot, maybe do both and have less enemies

maybe add skyrim style foosahra pushback or left for dead push back ability

maybe stamina bar for that or buy items from market

add shield bash attack (minimal damage or lots of knockback)

maybe parry/defend attack stuns enemies and changes textures/adds particle

more combat variability, add more to it then just blocking and attacking
